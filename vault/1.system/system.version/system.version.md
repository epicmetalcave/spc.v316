### SPEC-DOC

#### Extract
Retrieve current system state:
- OBJECTIVE
- FUNCTION
- OPERATION
- SPEC-INDEX
- SPEC-DOC (complete body content)

#### Transform
Apply modifications in collaboration:
- Update any changed properties
- Modify SPEC-DOC sections as needed
- Increment VERSION number
- Update date stamp

#### Document
Create changelog entry:
- List all changes made
- Document reasons for changes
- Note any breaking changes
- Reference related systems affected

#### Store
Save to `/1.system/system.version/system.version.[system.name].v[number].md`:
```markdown
## #system/version/[new] [[date]]
[Complete new version]

## #CHANGELOG/[old]-to-[new]
**Date:** [[date]]
**Changes:**
- [Property]: [what changed]
**Reason:** [why changed]

## #system/version/[old] [[date]]
[Complete old version]
```

#### Update
Push to main system file:
- Replace entire version section with new version
- Keep only current version in main file

#### Structure
File organization:
- Version files: `/1.system/system.version/system.version.[system.name].v[number].md`
- Process runs independently of system type
- Interface standardized via template
- Each version creates new file with incremented version number
