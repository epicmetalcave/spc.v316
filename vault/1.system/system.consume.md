### SPEC-DOC

#### Pattern
CONSUME defines permanent architectural dependencies:
- Structural relationships, not execution relationships
- Dependencies exist whether actively used or not
- Like electrical wiring - always present, activated by use
- Commands trigger consumption but don't create the relationship

#### Structure
- **Provider:** System that supplies data/functionality (unaware of consumers)
- **Consumer:** System that depends on provider's structure
- **Direction:** Always one-way (provider â†’ consumer)
- Consumer declares dependency via CONSUME property
- Provider remains independent

#### Rules
- One-way flow only (no circular dependencies)
- Provider can have multiple consumers
- Consumer breaks if provider interface changes
- Provider can evolve if interface maintained
- Dependencies are permanent, not conditional
- Consumption exists at system level, not command level

#### Implementation
In YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
CONSUME:
  - "[[github.repository]]"
  - "[[chat.context]]"
```
Consumer explicitly declares all provider systems it depends on.

#### Purpose
- Clear dependency tracking
- Prevent circular references
- Document data flow architecture
- Enable impact analysis
- Support plugin architecture
- Maintain clean system boundaries
- Foundation for architectural mapping
